# 🧩 Spiral Word Search Puzzle (C++)

This is a fun **C++ project** inspired by classic Sunday puzzles — but with a twist:  
It searches for words hidden in a **spiral or counter-spiral** pattern inside a 2D matrix.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Traverses a 2D grid (matrix) of strings
- Searches in **clockwise spiral** and **counter-clockwise spiral** order
- (Optional) Supports **counter-clockwise spiral** as an extension
- Builds and prints a string based on the traversal
- Great for solving or generating spiral-style word puzzles
